**Capturing an experience**:
What experience?
How do you capture it?

# User Journey Map

A user journey is a **visual representation** of the process of **how a customer interacts with your digital product or service** over time and across different platforms.

## Finding the Narrative

Dissect the **story** of the experience. The story can also be compared to the **timeline** of the experience.
You condense and polish it into **12 to 20 steps**.

## User Journey Map

The User Journey Map consists of **5/6 components** at Devine:

1. Action
2. Feeling
3. Thoughts
4. Touchpoint
5. (Pain points / Needs)
6. Opportunity

It shows their **actions, emotions, thoughts, touch points** at each stage of their journey.
Ultimately it helps you empathise and **identify opportunities**.

Mapping them can be done by using different models.

### 1 Action

What does the user **do**? This is a action that can be observed.
Capture key moments in up to 10 to 15 steps.

**_Pro Tip_**: Use active verbs.

### 2 Feeling

What emotion can you detect?
Be very specific with the emotion you assign.

**_Pro Tip_**: Use a pos/neg graph and emojis to visualise the emotions.

### 3 Thoughts

What does the user think?
This is internalised, or explained by the user.

**_Pro Tip_**: Find out the Why / Motivation.

### 4 Touch Points

What are you interacting with?
AKA **online / offline** contact moments?
Interaction based points in which a design intervention can impact the user's experience.

**_Pro Tip_**: Find the details in the ...; devices or touch points.

Add images above the touch points.

**_Pro Tip_**: Set an icon for all possible touch points. You can then add these for each action point.

### 6 Opportunity

What opportunities are there?

- Before you write the opportunity pinpoint the pain point or need in your user journey.
- Then look for digital improvement areas.

**_Pro Tip_**: Start your sentence with 'How Might We' to avoid giving solutions.

### Extra tips

Pin pointing moments of truths is important because these moments are the perfect "places"/opportunities to make a difference.

Add styling and visuals to make it easy and interesting to read. (Nobody wants to look at boring graphs or read boring blocks of text that have no colour.)
This can be done in many different ways:

- colours
- icons
- images
- emojis
- grouping
- ...

# Marketing: The sales funnel

A sales funnel is a series of steps that a potential customer goes through, from initial awareness of your product or service to making a purchase.

As a prospect passes through each stage of the funnel, it signifies a deeper commitment to the purchase goal.

The funnel follows the AIDA-model, the target audience's journey towards the purchase:

1. Awareness
2. Interest
3. Desire
4. Action

- Retention
- Loyalty

**Conversion rate**:
The percentage of people who enter your sales funnel and come out the other end after completing a specific action, such as a purchase.

**Improving the conversion rate**:
Coming up with ideas on how to improve your relation, communication and interaction with clients in each stage.

Raising the awareness does not necessarily mean you have more people at the end of your funnel.

AIDA displays the simplified user journey and helps you use intentional focused tactics to fix your leaky funnel. = STRATEGY
A leaky funnel means you have a low conversion rate.

The customer experience does not end at the AIDA-model.
POST-AIDA there are two more steps that aim to create repeat business and long term customers and ambassadors.
We are talking about retention and loyalty.

| Retention (MONEY): What's in it for me? | Loyalty (NO MONEY): Because i feel it is the right thing to do. |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transactional in nature.                    | Relational in nature.                                               |
| Aims to reduce churn by addressing needs.   | Encourages repeat behaviour through emotional ties.                 |
| Focusses on keeping customers engaged.      | Focusses on deepening emotional connection and trust.               |

**Tip**: Include the AIDA marketing funnel at the top to show stages in the user journey.
