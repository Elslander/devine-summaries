# What is UI design?

The visual styling of all user interface elements.

Some examples of UI-elements:

- texts
- buttons
- images
- icons
- navigation items
- animations
- ...

We off course need to keep usability, accessibility, graphic design / branding, consistency,... in mind.

## Design standards

- Base yourself on already existing **dedign standards**.
- You don't have to reinvent everything.
- Users use their **mental model - learning curve**!
- **visual language** is an added value.

# Colour use in UI design

The hierarchy of colour.

Colours should be:

- **consistent**:
  You should be able to recognise what website / brand you are seeing just by the colours.
- **distinct**
- **intentional**

Looking for more colours to use that fit within your colour palette? Use different shades of colours that are already present in the colour palette.

# Visual hierarchy in UI design

Visual hierarchy means the order in which the user will **scan** the different UI elements.

This enhances the user experience.

What matters?

- size
- colour
- _Gestalt principles_

## Gestalt principles

**Proximity**:
The space between elements determines if the users sees them as a group or as separate items.

**Similarity**:
...

**Common Region - Grouping**:
...

> something about shadows and shades

# Forms

Some examples of forms:

- login to your account
- register for Tomorrowland
- purchase your shoes
- ticket reservation
- book an overnight stay
- subscribe to a newsletter
- survey
- get your taxes done
- ...

Forms always have the same structure:

1. Question (label)
2. Answer (input)
3. Action (confirm)

A form has 5 important factors / aspects:

1. **Structure**: devision of the form, order of the questions.
2. **Input fields**: text fields, password fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, sliders,...
3. **Labels**: what is being asked for?
4. **Action**: at least 1 CTA.
5. **User feedback**: informs the user (both positive and negative)

## Structure

- Form are better when they are structured as one column.
- Group elements together if they are related to each other.

The _keep-cut-postpone-explain_ method:

- **Keep**: what is important, what should be asked?
- **Cut**: what should not be asked?
- **Postpone**: should we ask this now?
- **Explain**: explain why you ask certain information.

Progressive disclosure:

- reduces the cognitive load
- gradually reveals information / questions
- initially hides complex info or features

## Input

An input consists of the following parts:

Some examples of inputs:

- text
- checkbox (select multiple options)
- radio button (select one option)
- toggle switch (toggle an option, not used for more than 1 option)
- dropdown (5 - 10 options, use search option if there are to many options to choose from)
- date picker (a lot of clicking, good for a date range)
- date as text input (separate day, month and year)

## Labels

Make sure the label is always visible, also when the user is filling in the input field. **Don't use placeholders as labels**.
If you use placeholders as labels, make sure it stays visible while the user is filling in the input field. (moves up)

Labels should be above their respective input fields.

Leave more room above the label than in between the label and its input field.

## Action

Some rules for buttons:

- They should be recognisable.
- They should work according to already known rules.
  This increases the recognisability and therefore the ease of use (design pattern):
  - filled know with sharp corners
  - filled know with rounded corners
  - filled button with shadow
  - ghost knob

**White space**:

- Give your button enough white space.
- Both around the button (margin) and in the button (padding).

**Microcopy**:

- The text in the button should indicate what it does.
- Small text around the button gives the user a warning if necessary.

**Feedback**:

- The user knows when the click actually does something.

Buttons with different actions should **not** look the same.

## User feedback

### Validation

Input fields should have different states:

- inactive
- hover
- disabled
- focus / active
- validation
- error

**Inline validation**:

- placement near input field
- timing: just after filling in the field (not after filling in the entire form)
- use of colours (red-green)
- clear language

### Info / Help

For example when creating a password.

- password strength
- password guidelines

Provide additional options when something goes wrong.

### Status bar - Progress bar

Let the visitor know where he/she is in a particular flow.

How many steps are there?

- name of the steps
- completion / status
- current step.

### The end

Give the user feedback when they finish filling in the form.

Give the user visual feedback as well as text.

## Be real

Speak in the language of the user, not like a robot or system.

Communication should feel natural and logical.

Use the right tone of voice.

Use icons where possible.
