1. Understand the brief

## Understand the brief

- What is the objective of the brief?

- Clarify doubts

## Plan

# Communication

**Mood board VS Style board**:

- **Mood board**: A way to communicate the mood of your project. A mood board can result in different style boards.

## Mood board

A way to communicate the mood of your project.

Perfect tool to communicate to different people involved in the project.

**A mood board contains**:

- Colour guidance

- Textures
- Objects

**Don't do the following**:

- design of the board overrules the content
- the board does not fit the concept of the brief
- the board focusses to much on communicating a contept / idea
- not enough differentiation between the chosen images
- focusses to much on one section e.g. typography
- not enough images (min 10)
- the different images do not communicate a coherent style

## Style board

Focusses on the graphic style choices.

Perfect tool to communicate to peers, other graphic designer, the client.
