**User Group definition**: a detailed description for who you want to investigate and improve something. Traits, things that stand out, distinguish them, identify them as a group. Stakeholders and competitors.

**How to define a user group**:

- What are the relationships between these people, between these groups?
  - How are they involved in the problem?
  - Are they seen as enemies or as heroes of the problem?
  - Does a possible solution need their support or involvement?
- In the end, pick out the _strongest connection to your problem_.
- Who is the average user, average person experiencing the problem? What are they like? what are their qualifications?

**False consensus effect**:

...

You get to know your target audience by asking questions.

## Segmentation of users

Identify and select who your key audiences are. Break it down.

**Benefits of segmentation**:

- Multiple approaches / perspectives about a certain problem.
- No on-size-fits-all solution but a tailored experience for the people.
- Introduce changes in your product / service based on segments.

### Basic segmentation

- **Demographic**: Properties like age, gender, language, education level, occupation or income level.
- **Geographic**: Geographic areas such as countries, regions, or cities.
- **Behaviour**: Behavioral patterns that users experience towards using a particular product. These can include buying behaviors and actions (spending and consumption) and level of engagement.
- **Technology**: The level of users' tech savviness.
- **Psychographic**: About the user's interests, beliefs, affiliations, or socioeconomic status.

### Ecosustem mapping

- What are the **needs**, **context** and **history** of your target audience?
  - Don't limit your thinking just to the people you're designing for.
- What about the **community** around them? The **services** they rely on? The **government policies** that play a role in their lives?
  - You'll need some secondary research to do this.

**What is eco system mapping food for?**

- Good for setting up smart questions for the next step.
- The next step will be field research (primary research).

#### Step 1: The user

Think about the behaviour or outcome you want to help your user achieve.

To achieve that goal, what does our user need to know? to feel? to do? And where is our user right now with knowing, feeling? doing what is needed?

**Based on the above, what shifts might we need to support?**

- These are changes that the user needs to achieve.
- Try writing out each of the shifts as a From/To statement.

**Who or what might play a role in supporting or preventing those shifts?**

- These will be barriers or enablers created by others.
- Write them down and place them under the category or sphere that is most relevant below to explore further.

#### Step 2: The community

The household and social networks around our user.

Which individuals or groups play an important role in the user's life?

**For each group consider**:

- Is this a group a fan or a skeptic, with regard to what we want our user to achieve?
- In what ways do they support or block the user?
- What is the power dynamic between this group and the user - who has influence or control?

**Finally**:

- Based on the above, what kinds of shifts might be needed within this group?

#### Step 3: The services

The services & resources available to our user.

Which services does the user need to achieve their goal?

**For each service consider**:

- What kinds of access does the user have to this service, is it good quality?
- What challenges does the user face accessing the services?
- What challenges do the service providers face in delivering the service?
- Is this service, or its providers, something we might need to design for?

**Finaly**:

- Based on the above, what kinds of shifts might be needed with this service?

#### Step 4: The institutions

The systems & policies that influence our user's rights and freedom.

What are the rights and freedoms that the user needs to achieve their goal?

**For each right or freedom consider**:

- Does the user experience barriers or unequal access to this right or freedom?
- Which sustems and policies support the user with regards to this right or freedom? Which ones discriminate?

**Finally**:

- What should we consider as constraints or levers as we tackle this challenge?
