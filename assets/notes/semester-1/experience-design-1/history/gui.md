# Other GUIs (Summary)

## The rise of other competitive GUIs

During these times, many graphical interfaces emerged.

In **October 1983, VisiCorp** launched **VisiOn**, the **first full-fledged GUI** for the IBM PC—predating Windows by two years.

Soon after, **Quarterdeck** announced its GUI, **DESQ**, for the IBM PC. The race for GUIs was on, but surprisingly, **Bill Gates wasn’t leading yet**.

Microsoft set its **Windows** release date for **May 1984**, leveraging its industry influence via **MS-DOS** (installed by default on IBM PCs). Many hardware manufacturers committed, but IBM chose **VisiOn** and began developing apps for it. By May 1984, it became clear Windows wasn’t ready.

Instead, **MS-DOS 3.0** launched with a basic GUI—missing promised features. Windows was delayed until **June 1985**, giving competitors time to grow. IBM’s DESQ faltered due to weak apps, but **Digital Research's GEM GUI** surged ahead, selling 150,000+ copies in months. However, **Apple threatened legal action** due to GEM’s similarity to Macintosh. GEM was pulled, reworked, and Windows regained ground. With MS-DOS's popularity, **Microsoft began its rise to dominance**.

## Windows

**Windows launched in November 1985**, a year after the Macintosh. Evolving from MS-DOS, it was created by **Bill Gates and Paul Allen** for IBM PCs. Its GUI replaced memorizing text commands with point-and-click simplicity.

Over the next 25 years, **Macintosh and Windows defined the GUI**, until mobile devices fragmented the market again.

## User Conceptual Models (Xerox Star Influence)

When designing Xerox Star, researchers emphasized **user conceptual models** to guide GUIs:

> **Excerpt from: Designing the Xerox "Star" User Interface (Byte, 1982)**  
> A **user's conceptual model** is the set of concepts people acquire to explain a system’s behavior. Designers must choose models familiar to users. Xerox Star used the **metaphor of a physical office**, creating **electronic equivalents**: paper, folders, file cabinets, mailboxes. These **visual metaphors reduced training needs** and made systems feel intuitive.

Actions mirrored real life:

- Moving a file = dragging it to a file cabinet icon
- Selecting = clicking an icon
- Editing = direct manipulation on-screen

## Microsoft Bob (1995)

**Microsoft Bob** aimed to make Windows ultra-user-friendly. It featured:

- **A house-based GUI**: Rooms represented tasks (desk for word processing, clock for calendar).
- **Customization**: Users could decorate rooms and themes.
- **Rover (assistant)**: A cartoon dog similar to Word’s paperclip.

However, **Bob failed**: its childish visuals alienated adults, its helper was ineffective, and bugs plagued it. Despite its failure, it pioneered **personalized interfaces** and **companion icons**.

## Xerox Guiding Principles

Xerox PARC established UX principles that still apply today:

| Easy        | Hard        |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Concrete    | Abstract    |
| Visible     | Invisible   |
| Copying     | Creating    |
| Choosing    | Filling in  |
| Recognizing | Generating  |
| Editing     | Programming |
| Interactive | Batch       |

### Examples:

- **Choosing vs. Filling In**: Use dropdowns/radio buttons over text fields to reduce errors and cognitive load.
- **Recognizing vs. Generating**: Templates (Google Docs, Miro boards) improve usability over starting from scratch.

These principles showed: **simpler interfaces increase engagement**. Users preferred clicking options over typing commands. This shaped the **modern GUI**, completing the shift from **"human computers" to "computers for humans."**

## Towards a Mobile Future

Phones evolved from call-only devices to **multifunctional mobile computers** (smartphones, wearables, tablets). Mobile transformed industries (e.g., mobile payments, app stores) and overtook desktop in web traffic.

Today’s **Android/iOS ecosystems** offer millions of apps, but their roots trace back to **early handheld devices**.

## The First Handheld Devices

### Early 1980s: Psion Organiser

- **World’s first PDA (1984)**: 14x9cm, 2KB RAM, 4KB ROM, 6-month battery life.
- Apps: simple games, password protection, file manager.

#### Psion’s OS (EPOC):

- Late '80s: Enabled advanced apps (word processing, spreadsheets).
- Download apps via modem.
- Became **Symbian OS**, later used by **Nokia, Samsung, Motorola**, paving the way for modern mobile OS design.

---

### 1996: Palm Pilot

- Released by **Palm**: 128–512KB memory, 160x160 monochrome touchscreen.
- Features: **touchscreen, data sync, stylus input**, memory expansion (up to 2MB).
- Influenced smartphone design, evolving into **Handspring Treo (2002)** and **Palm Pre (2011)**.
- Ultimately overtaken by **iOS and Android**.

Palm laid the foundation for many smartphone features we now take for granted.

## The Era of the Mobile Phone

### 1992: The World's First Ever SMS

The first text message ever sent was just two words: **"Merry Christmas"**. On December 3rd, 1992, Neil Papworth, a developer for Vodafone, sent it from an **Orbitel 901 handset** (not even a real mobile phone yet).

Early texting was clunky:

- No proper keypads; typing "C" meant pressing "2" three times.
- Texting across different networks wasn’t possible until **1999**.
- Messages were limited to **160 characters** on tiny screens displaying only 2–4 lines of text.

These limitations birthed **"txt spk"** (LOL, BRB) and emoticons :-) — precursors to modern emojis.

### 1997: Snake on the Nokia 6110

The Nokia 6110 came preloaded with **Snake**, arguably the first viral mobile game. It marked the start of **entertainment-focused mobile design**.

---

## Nokia Goes Wild

In the early 2000s, **Nokia dominated the market**, experimenting wildly with phone shapes, interfaces, and features. Phones became **fashion accessories**, and UI experimentation was rampant:

- **Nokia 7600 (2003)**: Square shape, awkward to hold, sideways talking required.
- **Nokia 5510 (2001)**: Keyboard split around the screen. Unconventional enough that Nokia’s ad tagline admitted it: _"Looks weird, sounds right."_
- **Nokia 3650 (2003)**: Rotary-style keypad — visually bold but impractical for texting.
- **Nokia 2300 (2003)**: A quirky keypad with no logical pattern.

By then, phones had **colour screens**, and manufacturers competed on **pixel density, camera quality, and features**. Devices evolved into **"feature phones"**: adding internet access, games, GPS, and customizable wallpapers.

- **Nokia 7280 (2004)**: No keypad or touchscreen—users scrolled letters with a physical dial!
- **Nokia N95 (2006)**: The true proto-smartphone: Wi-Fi, web browsing, GPS, and a 5MP camera. It sold over **1M units in the UK**, holding off BlackBerry briefly.

---

## Technology's Evolution Cycle

The mobile phone illustrates the **3-stage tech evolution**:

1. **Hardware First**: Infrastructure improves (clearer calls, pixel-dense screens, smaller devices).
2. **Feature Explosion**: Competition drives complexity—GPS, games, cameras, endless add-ons.
3. **Refinement**: Return to simplicity—core needs prioritized, clutter removed.

This final simplification was about to begin with **the iPhone**.

## The iPhone and When the World Went Flat

### 2007: The iPhone Revolution

At the 2007 Apple WWDC, **Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone**, forever transforming mobile design.

Key innovations:

- **Multitouch Screen**: Pinch-to-zoom, tilt-sensitive orientation.
- **App Store Ecosystem**: A clear path for developers to build and market apps.

Apple’s early **skeuomorphic design** bridged real-world familiarity into digital:

- Notes app = lined notebook
- Calculator = real calculator
- Trash can icon = literal bin

Psychologist **James Gibson’s "affordances"** concept underpinned this: designs mirrored physical cues so users instinctively understood their functions.

However, skeuomorphism soon **cluttered interfaces**. A generation raised with digital devices no longer needed metaphors like fake leather textures.

---

### 2008: Android Joins the Fight

The first Android phone, **HTC Dream**, launched in 2008.

Early competition included **Symbian (Nokia), Palm, and BlackBerry**, but Android and iOS soon dominated by combining:

- Rich **app ecosystems** (drawing both users and developers)
- Frequent updates & improved hardware integration
- Business-grade security

---

### 2010: Flat Design & Windows Phone

Microsoft introduced the **Metro UI (later "Microsoft Design Language")**, inspiring a move away from skeuomorphism:

- **Flat planes & bold colors**
- **Clean typography (Segoe)**
- No glossy 3D effects or heavy shadows

Though **Windows Phone failed commercially**, its aesthetic influenced modern UI and inspired **Apple’s iOS 7 flat redesign** under **Jony Ive**:

- Minimalism replaced textures
- Clean lines and light interfaces prioritized usability

---

## The iPad: A "Big Phone" Becomes a Game-Changer

In **2010**, Apple launched the **iPad**, met with skepticism ("just a big phone?"). Yet it quickly reshaped:

- **Retail** (iPads replaced cash registers)
- **Healthcare** (doctors using tablets)
- **Media** (Oprah’s digital magazine showcase)

### Apple's Bold Move: No Flash

Apple refused to support **Adobe Flash**, backing **HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript** for open, mobile-friendly web standards. This forced designers to rebuild interactive sites without Flash, pushing responsive web design forward.

---

## Google Material Design (2014)

Google bridged skeuomorphism and flat design with **Material Design**:

- **Physics-based interactions** (inertia, depth effects)
- **Digital-native "materials"** (elements behave like tangible surfaces)
- **Clear hierarchy via shadows & motion**

Code-named **"Quantum Paper"**, it shipped with strict guidelines and components:

- Buttons, menus, animations with standardized behavior
- Iconography designed for purpose (vs iOS’s rounded squares)

Material Design **redefined Android UX** and influenced web/app design industry-wide.

---

**From skeuomorphism to flat design to Material**, mobile UI evolved toward clarity, simplicity, and tactile digital-native interactions—ushering in the modern UX era.
