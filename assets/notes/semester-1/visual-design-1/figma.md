# Figma introduction

Figma is a vector design tool that runs in the browser and in the app.<br />
First install Figma. Make sure you have an education account.

Figma has a great online learning platform. If you have any problem in Figma, first look it up on their online platform. We put all the links of the features you need to know (and be able to use) in this document.

## The basics

First we will see the basic features from Figma. You can compare those to the ones you learned in Adobe Illustrator.

- Creating frames
- Create layouts: use rulers or grids
- Create basic shapes: rectange, ellipse, pen tool,...
- Align, adjust, rotate
- Present your prototype

## Components

Components are elements you can reuse across your designs. They help to create and manage consiustent designs across projects.

We use components to create buttons, menu items, cards,...<br />
Group all your main components in a separate artboard, called 'Components' or 'Styleguide'.

## Text styles & Colour styles

Styles allows you to define a set of properties that can be reused across your team or organisation's files and projects. Use text styles to define typographic scale within your designs.

You can create styles for text and colours. This feature is not in illustrator, but unique (and very handy) in Figma.

## Export

When your project is ready to be seen, you can either export the design in png, pdf, jpg,... or you can export an url and share those with others. In your Devine assignment, we usually expect you to do both.

## Extras

Figma has a great community and a lot of free (and paid) plugins. Take a look at their plugins. They might be handy.
