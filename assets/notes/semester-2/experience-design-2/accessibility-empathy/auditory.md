# Video guidelines

For people with an auditory disability video content can be challenging. There are guidelines for designers and developers on what you should do with video material in your digital products.

A video is accessible according to level AA on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines if:

- The video's control buttons are accessible.
- There are text alternatives to the audible and visual information.
- For a video without sound, containing only visual information, a text version is sufficient. Adding an audio track can also be a solution.
- Subtitles for the deaf or hard of hearing are available for all videos with sound.
- Audio description is provided for each video containing visual information.
- The sound does not start automatically.
- the video does not contain flashes with a frequency of more than 3 per second.

# Haptic feedback

While traditional interfaces rely heavily on visual and auditory cues, haptic interfaces introduce a third dimension to user interaction: touch. By leveraging vibrations, pressure, and other tactile sensations, these interfaces bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds, creating more immersive and intuitive experiences.

Haptic feedback is not a new concept. **Apple's Taptic Engine** was originally introduced in 2015 in the Apple Watch, and incorporated later into the Iphone. Early implementation can be traced back to simple vibrations in mobile phones or gaming controllers. Having specific haptic feedback occur for certain scenarios can provide cues into what's happening on-screen. However, advancements in sensor technology, coupled with sophisticated actuators, have unlocked a new era of haptic innovation. Today, haptic interfaces are at the forefront of UI design, promising to revolutionise industries ranging from gaming and automotive to healthcare and beyond.

Haptic movements **increase accessibility for all users**, but especially for users who have visual or hearing disabilities, as they alert people to key actions or moments without even having to look at or listen to the device.

Having tactile feedback **helps guide users toward what actions are _correct_** or produce a desired output from their device.
Haptic feedback has been seen it improve accuracy for some touchscreen action.

## Haptics in Steering Wheels

Since 2022 Audi has incorporated haptic feedback technology into a couple of features for its electric vehicles, including the touchscreen and buttons on the steering wheel.
Audi's MMI touch response system helps drivers heep their eyes on the road while using other features. Touchscreens are especially **difficult to navigate while driving**, but haptic feedback can let the driver know if a button was successfully selected, **saving an extra glance back at the screen**.

## The near future?

### Haptic Braille Displays

University of Bayreuth is Germany has developed HaptiRead, a device that uses ultrasonic waves to project Braile onto users' fingertips. While this technology us not yet available to the public, these type of research and ideas have the potential to make braille a good alternative to other tipes of assistive technology.

### Ultrasonic Speakers

_Ultraleap_ sells haptic hand-tracking technology that uses ultrasound instead of vibrations to transmit haptic sensations. These devices are made of an array of small ultrasound speakers which send ultrasonic waves through the air to collide at specific focal points. Users can move their hands through the space in front of the device and feel the landscape of focal points, which are experience against the skin as pressure, creating a haptic sensation.
