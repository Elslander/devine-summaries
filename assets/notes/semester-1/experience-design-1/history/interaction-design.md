# Interaction Design (Summary)

## 1. The Computer is Central

- Initially, computers were seen as tools to **eliminate human error** rather than as user-focused devices.
- Early "computers" were people doing repetitive calculations (18th century).
- **Charles Babbage** designed the Analytical Engine to automate these tasks; **Ada Lovelace** wrote the first computer programs and envisioned broader uses beyond math.
- The **Industrial Revolution** made machines commonplace and smaller, integrating them into daily life.
- **Murphy's Law (Edward Murphy):** Systems had to be designed to prevent inevitable human errors.

## 2. The User is Central

- **1960s shift:** Focus moved toward human-computer interaction. Computers needed interfaces accessible beyond engineers.
- **Ivan Sutherland:** Created _Sketchpad_ (first graphical interface & window system). Introduced object-oriented concepts but had usability challenges (light pen, poor displays).
- **Douglas Engelbart:**
  - Invented the mouse, refined GUIs, and emphasized studying users directly.
  - Developed **NLS**, featuring real-time collaboration, hypertext links, and early video conferencing (“Mother of all Demos”).

## 3. Alan Kay & The Computer as Medium

- Designed **FLEX** and **Smalltalk (OOP)**; envisioned the **Dynabook** (tablet-like PC for children).
- Saw computers as **a medium for communication**, creativity, and learning, not just calculation.
- Advocated for early exposure to computers like we give children pen and paper.

## Key Shifts in Interaction Design

- From **machines replacing humans** → to **humans interacting with machines**.
- From **calculation tools** → to **communication & creative mediums**.
- Influenced by major figures: **Babbage, Lovelace, Sutherland, Engelbart, Kay**.
