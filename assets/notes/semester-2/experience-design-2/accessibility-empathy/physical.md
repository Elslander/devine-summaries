# What can you do as a designer?

What you can do as a designer was mentioned in the previous video. Assistive technology user for alternative input was addressed in the live lecture. Below are some general tips on how to make your design accessible for people with alternative input devices.

## Difficulties with drag & drop, sliders and swiping

- Some people with motor disabilities cannot hold down a cursor or make movements in different directions. Assistive software can offer solutions, but these are time-consuming. Even using a finger on a small touch screen can make practice difficult.
- For a visually impaired person who uses a large zoom factor and sees only a small part of the page, the exercise is very complicated because he or she does not know in which direction to move the words.
- For blind people, drag-and-drop exercises are not feasible because they cannot see where the cursor is.

## Solution

To make interfaces with **drag-and-drop** usable for everyone:

- Provide an alternate that works with clicks (one or more) and does not require combinations of movements.
- Ensure that the interface is also usable with the keyboard. If the alternative uses standard accessible interface elements, this will automatically be the case.
- Make sure the interface is understandable without vision and operable with a screen reader.

# Haptic feedback (again)

When people miss an arm or a finger or a leg, they lose functionality. But they also loose touch. An under appreciated sense in our life. In this video you see how neuro scientists and technology experts come together to make a physical disability disappear and extend heir knowledge to the VR world. What if we could hack our nervous systems so that virtual worlds also included a realistic sense of touch? The company Afference has found a way to create an interface between the digital reams and your nervous system with tech that talks directly to your nerves using small electrical signals.
