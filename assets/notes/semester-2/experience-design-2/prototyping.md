# Fail faster

## Paper prototyping

Paper prototyping is a process where design teams create paper representations of digital products to help them **realise concepts** and **test designs**. They draw sketches or adapt printed materials and use these low-fidelity screenshot samples to cheaply guide their designs and study users' reactions from early in projects.

**When to use a paper prototype**:

- Testing user interactions.
- To present your solution.
- In novel situations.

> **Nielsen** (2003)
> With a paper prototype, you can user **test** early design ideas at an extremely low cost. Doing so lets you fix usability problems before wasting money implementing something that doesn't work.

Prototypes beg to be interacted with.

# Getting started with a cardboard prototype

## 1 The fold

**Folding instructions**:

- The valley fold (fold in)
- The mountain fold (fold out)
- Numbering (pieces)

**Japanese pepakura**:
This technique was adopted for initial rapid prototypes. Pepakura transforms a 3D model into advanced folding instructions that can be printed on any paper.
If you can dream it, you can create it. Make your own low poly 3D model in Blender or even Photoshop.

## 2 Layering cardboard

One interesting way to work with corrugated cardboard is to pile it in multiple layers. Sheets are cut and glued together layer after layer until building a full strong 3D prototype. This building process can be called '_cut & stack_'.

## 3 Press fit

Press fit a.k.a. slots is when the fit of a shaft is driven into a hole slightly smaller than itself and held tight and motionless.

## 4 Glide

Gliding is a way to create moving parts in your cardboard prototype, or making fabric-like or grid-like shapes.

## 5 Curved joints

Cutting halfway through your cardboard at steady intervals allows you to create smooth curves.
