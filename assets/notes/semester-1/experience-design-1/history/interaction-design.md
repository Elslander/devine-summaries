## The computer is central

> **Alan Kay**<br />
> Th best way to predict the future, is to invent it.

**Information Architecutre** focusses on collecting and organizing the information on a website. **Interaction Design** focusses on the actions people need to take to get things done. **Usaibility** will then again focus on the best way to conduct these actions and evaluate and test this.

All these fields of study have one element in common: they place the **user** at the center. The user becomes the most important element during the conception, programming and design of an interface. Each area of study focusses on a different component. However, this has not always been the case.<br />
**There was only a slow evolution from human computers to computers for humans.**

Because the computer - from desktop, to kitchen appliance, to smartwatch - has become part of our lives, we find it obvious that we 'the user' is taken into account. However, the relationship between humans and computer has changed as technology has evolved and research into **human behaviour** has yielded new results. The first computer had much more in comman with humans than today's computers. After all, they were people.

In the early 18th century, astronomers were investigating complex problems that required extensive calculations. The first people were hired to do these calculations. These people were called 'computers'. Over the next 100 years, more and more methematical problems were explored that required increasing reliance on human computers.

Some calculations were repeated so many times that books were published. These books contained long tables that were supposed to speed up the calculations. More and more people became dependent on these tables such as captains, engineers,... The big problem was that these calculations were still done by people. And these people were bad computers. **People are usually bad at repetitive tasks** without variety. Boredom sets in, attention disappears and mistakes are made. The tables were therefore **full of errors**.

By **1830, Charles Baddage** had had enough. He realised that a machine would do this job much faster and more accurately. After all, these are made to perform repetitive tasks. They have no attention that can disappear and they never get bored. When a machine makes a mistake, it is usually quite catastrophix, leaving little chance for mistakes to pass unnoticed.

As an engineer, Baddage made a prototype. He showed this to **Ada Lovelace**. She was a British mathematician who is today considered **the designer of the first computer program**.

She was thefirst to write 'programs' to manipulate symbols according to set rules with a machine that Baddage had yet to make. She also realised that computers were capable of more than just (heavy) calculations, when others - including Baddage himself - were only interested in the arithmetic capabilities of a computer.

The form and function of Baddage's Analytical Engine were inspired, in part, by a loom. In the 19th century, the Jacquard loom was invented to automate the weaving of complex patterns into textiles. A series of reusable punch cards were fed into the loom to determine the design, essentially programming the pattern of th textile. The Analytical Engine, although never built, was also designed to use punch cards. But instead of weaving patters, these punch cards would instead contain formula and data. In fact, Lovelace wrote that 'We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves'.

Ada was also the first to describe the concept of software and a computer. she thought of a program that could compose music in an analytical way. However, she could never fully develop her own ideas because she died of cancer at the age of 36.

The programming language Ada, developed by the US Department of Defense, was named after het in 1979. In the end, both people did not immediately lead to a working version. The cost of building Baddage"s machines that could run Ada's programs was too high and the construction too difficult. This caused people to lose confidence and interest in the idea.

> What is evident from the history of the computer is the vision that prevailed at that time. Man was a being that made mistakes as opposed to the computer that was flawless. The computer was a means of avoiding those mistakes. Any user was not taken into account. This one used a computer just like a calculator: to get an outcome displayed that he himself could hardly or not calculate. Each 'computer' also had only one purpose, and was used for that specific purpose.

### Influence of the Industrtial revolution

By WWII the world had changed quite a bit. The Industrial Revolution had brought many changes to the technological landscape. The Industrial Revolution started in England in the late 18th century and continued through the rest of Europe in the early 19th century. The application of the steam engine gave an enormous impulse to the development of the manufacture of products. Craft and small-scale workshops grew into large factories and together formed a large-scale industry. Due to this growth, the price of products fell enormously, so that more and more people could afford them. There was sufficient capital to invest in new technologies. Machines were powerd by electricity towards the end of the revolution. There were fast ways to communicate such as radio and television.

And everything got smaller and smaller. The machine gradually became part of everyday life. From the 1950s, every kitchen was full of machines that made life more pleasant.

People and machines were constantly interacting. Naturally, this is also where the first problems with amchines appeard. When people and machines didn't work well together, the consequences were usually catastrophic.

### Murphy's Law

> **Edward Murphy**<br />
> If there is more than one way to do a job, and one of those ways will result in disaster, then somebody will do it that way.

Murphy's law is famous all over the world. What is less well known is that he was an American aerospace engineer who worked on safety-critical systems.

He formulated his 'Murphy's Law' targeting the systems he developed. He believed that **people** were not just regular mistakes, but **walking disasters**. The challenge was to develop the human-computer interface in such a way that all possible human errors were eliminated. With a design, all focus had to be on the people who will work with the design. The result was that we got more and more information about the dynamic functioning between humans and computers.

## The user is central

In the early 1960s, people really out the interaction between humans and computers in a different light. Up to this point, there were still no real interfaces. Computers were made for and by engineers. They still served mainly to make calculations that were too complicated for humans or that had a strong repetitiveness. Sometimes entering the data was done with **visualisation of the data on the screen**, but there was no direct interaction with that screen.

So this changed. People were again recognised for their strength and not blamed for their weakness. The limitations of computers also became more and more apparent. Although people are bad at repetitive tasks, they are intelligent. Computers arent, they don't have (in that time). their own form of intelligence.

In the general attitude op to that point a change came through **Ivan Sutherland**. He was a doctoral student who made a work on **communication between computers and people**. The result of his research was the '**Sketchpad**' program. This is the **first interactive graphics program**. We see for the first time the possibility to create graphic elements directly on the screen.

You could make more complex graphics in combination with the buttons and apply mathematics to repeat, rotate, duplicate,...

In 1962 this was the first system on the market with a 'window'. The program was able to solve nonlinear problems. We also see **Object Oriented Programming** here for the first time. Instances and master drawings were used. All these instances were dynamically modfied when something was changed on the master. This is the work of one individual and will affect the entire history of the interface and the computer.

The **light pen** was used as control. This pen must be placed perfectly horizontal on the display. Because of this it was usually impossible to continue working after 20 minutes because the blood flow in the hand was too poor. The display is not yet a display as we know it. The screen flickers constantly and makes it difficult to concentrate for long.

**Specifics of the Sketchpad**:

- 1st Graphical interface
- 1st human-computer interface = window
- poor quality of display
- difficult use of lightpen
- no standard controls like a keyboard > complex button system
- works with symbols and instances

Douglas Engelbart changed this in 1968. He was among other things the inventor of the mouse, and the black and white display. Instead of thinking about what users might want, he went to the offices to study people and ask questions. In this way **he placed human beings completely at the center of the discussion**, rather than the possibilities of the machine. This was a big switch in perception.

He made a **keyboard** where you could operate the entire keyboard with just 5 keys. Your left kand on those 5 keys and your right hand on the mouse. In this way, he said, work could be done much more efficiently. Another example of putting people at the center is incorporating the keyboard into the armrest of a chair. After all, Engelbart had discovered that people do not always sit perfectly at their desks. People rotate in their chairs and that does not always make it easy to place both hands on the keyboard.

Douglas developed an online system where computer could get linked! In lieu of asynchronous, batch processing, the NLS **allowed users to manipulate on-screen data directly and see the results immediately in real-time**. In lieu of punched cards, the NLS featured a radar-like screen with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**, in which users **manipulated text, symbols, and video in a series of overlapping 'windows'**. For example, users could insert, delete, and move text withing a document. Via 'hypertext' links, users could also jump quickly between two related documents. The NLS also supported collaboration; when multiple NLS systems were linked together, **users could work simultaneously on the same document**.

Many years before others would follow him, he was already implementing **video conferencing**. It was his idea of what interaction on the computer should look like. It wasn't until 1991 that **The Trojan Coffee Room** ushered inthe **webcam** era/ So it was going to take some time before Engelbart's ideas were developed for the general public. 

His demo is often referenced to as tje mother of all demo's.

We see for the first time in the history of the computer that the end user could interact directly with the computer. <br />
You didn't have to be a real engineer anymore. But work was still done via commands, e.g. draggin an object happened in 4 steps:

1. You give the command to move
2. You indicate which object
3. Then indicate the end goal
4. Finally, you give a confirmation

The first personal computer (although this is also disputed by some) was the **Altair MITS 8800**. It retailed for $439 in 1974. Several more computers came on the market at that time, some more successful than others. In the course of history, along with the technological development of the computer, we see the development of the interface. In this module we will mainly focus on the most important steps that influenced the **interface design**.

### Intro: Alan Kay

One of the first personal computers intended for the general public operated on the computer language **FLEX**. The memory was 8k and the user memory was 48k. There were several programs that you could run on this: texteditors, database managers, Pascal, spreadsheets, spelling check,...

The designer of this was **Alan Kay**. During his studies he had to study Sutherland's paper and learned a lot about the way of programming and visualisation. He would also later work briefly with Sutherland.

His vision was shaped, among other things bu studying **cells**. First, each cell responds to a master behaviour. Second, each cell is an autonomous entity and they communicate with each other by sending messages. Third, cells can evolve into different parts of an organism according to context. From this vision he started developing another programming language called **SMALLTALK**/ This language is completerly OO(P).

However, the FLEX never really caught on: The interface scared people off. The designers (including Alan Kay) did not understand why this was at first. <br />
They wen to **investigate** and a train of thought ensued.

> **The computer was no longer a technological tool in industry but a medium**. <br />
> A way to communicate with each other just like we use writing and for example a newspaper to tell the daily news.

Alan Kay is still known for this change in attitude towards computers, among other things. Like Douglas, he brought about a major shift. Alan's big dream was a personal computer the size of a notbook (A4). He was already talking about tablet PCs when the technology for this was not available. His **Dynabook** was an example of this. He also preferred to see this in the hands of children. Like Engelbart, Alan saw great use in studying people while they worked with a computer. From an early age we are stimulated to express ourselves, to communicate. It was not until **1970 that the computer was seen as a means of daily communication**.

> **Alan Kay**<br />
> We give small children a pen and paper as soon as possible to communicate. We give them a medium to express them. Maybe we can do the same with the computer. Using the computer as a medium between people to communicate, express themselves, convey or collect information,...

One of the most famous programs from this period was **Space War!**. With some discussion one could say that this was the first computer game. It was based entirely on vectors. You had to have a human opponent before you could play. So there was no single player mode. For 1 quarter one could play for 1 minute, for 10 dollars both players could play for an hour. This sample followers. The computer had completely detached from its old position.

**It became a medium for communication and relaxation**.
