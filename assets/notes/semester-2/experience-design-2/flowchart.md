# Information Architecture (I.A.)

Information architecture involves organising information in an understandable and useful manner.

For complex websites you map the structure in a flowchart.

## For a website

How to communicate Information Architecture and [[Interaction Design]] in Web Development teams?

Make a chart using basic symbology for diagramming Information Architecture and [[Interaction Design]] concepts.

## Flow...

There are 3 main flows in site structure when looking at Information Architecture:

1. Hierarchical site
2. Sequence site
3. Web-linked site (matrix)

### Hierarchical site

Most websites fall under this category. Also known as a **top-down** approach, **tree structure**, or **parent** / **child** relationships between pieces of information.

User starts with broader information categories (parent) and then moves further into the structure to find narrower, more detailed information (child).

### Sequence site

Websites with sequential structures require users to go **step-by-step** and follow a **specific path** through the content.
An example of this type of structure is when a user tries to make a **purchase** or takes a **course** online.
Successive structures assume that there is an **optimal ordering of content** associated with greater effectiveness or succes.

### Web-linked site

Also known as a **matrix structure**.
Here users can determine their own path, because **content is linked** in different ways.

This type of structure takes full advantage of the principles behind hypertext or HTML.
For example, one user may choose to navigate a set of content based on the date, while another user navigates based on the topic.

# How many pages?

This depends on how much content you have.
To know that, you must check your content list which is comprised of the **minimal content** and the **user specific content**.

If you have too little content, consider scrapping a page.
If you have to much content, consider adding a page.

## Minimal content

This is the **foundational content** that almost every site in your industry includes. You research competitors and similar sites to see what they have, ensuring you don't miss essential pages or elements.

## User specific content

Here you suggest content based on your target audience's needs.
Use a **content matrix**.

- content type
- description
- justification
- rating
