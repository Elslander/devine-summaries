**(\*) You have a certain level of creative freedom with these items as they act as elements to create extra empathy. Beware: all other items should be based on hard cold data.**

### Needs & values & frustrations

These are the extra's that make a persona even more human and usable in your workflow.

### More info?

Personas are a realistic yet fictional profiling of the archetype.

The more information you have, the more you can process it in your persona sheet.

However, you should always refer to the evidence in your data for this.

## Why should you use a persona?

### When do you need it?

In every step of the way. Writing out a persona enables you to **share your research findings**. This should be utilised in further steps and **decision points** of the project.

- ideation phase
- scenario creation
- content analysis
- design
- (prototype) development
- usability testing

### Why do we use it?

#### Reason 1:

To better understand our end usr and to **empathise** with the situation and feeling of others.

It makes it easy to communicate about the target audience with understanding.

#### Reason 2:

As an easy **cheat sheet** about the different type of users.

During a project you could get lost in all the information, it is an easy reference to earlier research work done on the target audience.

#### Reason 3:

To highlight **unique differences** in user needs, behaviours and expectations.

To create tailored solutions in the next phase.

#### Reason 4:

To enable **decision making** in content + feature analysis, design choices, and technological choices.

They give the designer/developer/marketing team/... a **common goal** and **focus**. They form the basis for future design decisions.
