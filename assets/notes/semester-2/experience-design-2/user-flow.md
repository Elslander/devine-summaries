# User goal
User goals are descriptions of end states that users want to reach.
- **Life goals** (reflective): who the user wants to be.
- **End goals** (behavioural): what the user wants to do.
- **Experience goals** (visceral): how the user wants to feel.
# Task flow
Task flows are typically linear and represent the high-level actions that a user could take **to arrive at a particular objective or endpoint**.

Can be used to script user tests to prepare prototypes and compare to desirable, expected outcomes.

# Wire flow

A wire-flow is a hybrid design document that combines wire-framing with flow diagramming?

# User flow

A user flow is a flowchart that documents **all possible steps** a user can take to accomplish a significant goal.
