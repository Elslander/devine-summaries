# The Neurodivergent experience - Differently wired brains

## History

'**_Neurodiversity_**' was first used in 1998 by Judy Singer, an Australian sociologist, to recognise that everyone's brain develops in a unique way. People who are neurodivergent and learn that it means they're different - not sick or defective.

**Neurodivergent** is a non-medical term that describes people whose brains develop or work differently for some reason. This mean the person has different strengths and struggles from people whose brains develop or work more neurotypically. While some people who are neurodivergent have medical conditions, it also happens to people where a medical condition or diagnosis hasn't been identified.

## Strengths & Struggles

An example of this is someone who has **dyslexia**. People with that condition struggle to read because their brain doesn't process written language like the brain of someone without dyslexia. However, people with dyslexia usually have brains that are better at processing or mentally picturing 3D objects. That makes them much faster at identifying optical illusions, and they have a natural talent for jobs like graphic design and arts, engineering and more.

Some other condition among those describe themselves as neurodivergent include:

- autism
- adhd
- dyscalculia
- dysgraphia
- dyslexic
- social anxiety
- ...

Some neurodivergent people struggle because of systems or processes that don't give them a chance to show off their strengths or that create new or more intense challenges for them.

**Assisted technology can help**. This refers to any tool or device that helps individuals overcome challenges and perform tasks more easily. These technologies can be incredibly helpful for people who experience sensory overload, executive functioning, or other challenges.

For neurodivergent individuals, this may include tools like:

- noise-canceling headphones
- colour-coded calendars
- or apps that help with time management and organisation

## 1 Social interaction and communication

People who are neurodivergent often excel at communicating in online spaces. That's because non-verbal communication - such as eye contact, facial expressions and body language - doesn't have to be a part of online interaction. This energy can then be used to accomplish their goal, instead of thinking about how they may be (mis)perceived. Masking occurs when a person tries to hide their symptoms to seem 'normally functioning'. This takes a lot of mental energy and when repeated over time can lead to a loss of self-identity.

**Promote online self-expression**:

- provide customisable avatars and profiles
- encourage diverse content creation
- provide accommodations during online social situations
- facilitate body doubling

## 2 Cognitive ability

Cognitive abilities refer to such things as attention, memory, and problem-solving skills. ADHD brains are wired for interest and struggle to keep focus and access motivation when there isn't enough simulation or dopamine connected to the task. This makes it very hard to initiate and complete certain tasks. Using technology like social media or gaming gives quick dopamine hits that feel good short-term but can hurt focus and make it harder to start and finish longer tasks - a pattern often called '_TikTok Brain_'.

Once successfully initiated, getting distracted or time blinded, and losing focus on the priorities can be a disaster for the set 'to do' list.
Things you can do in your design:

- block off distraction
- communicate mindfully
- set reminders: visual timer and structured breaks from pomodoro app.
- visualise to do's
- implement predictable reward systems: such designs can help manage dopamine release, supporting sustained motivation and task initiation.
- design consistent feedback mechanics
- offer clear progress indicators

Be aware that this may not be enough, if there isn't enough variety or novelty, the brain will likely begin to **feel under stimulated**.

**Incorporate stimulating yet controlled elements**:

- use interactive features that engage without overwhelming.
- Provide dynamic content to cater to different stimulation needs.

## 3 Executive Dysfunction

Executive dysfunction is something that happens when there is an issue with prioritising time perception and working memory. These struggles can overwhelm and make the person 'freeze' unable to take the next step.

When the nervous system goes into overdrive, the body goes into survival mode: such as keeping the hart beating, and shut down anything non essential - including the person's ability to feel present and process new information. This person is overwhelmed and seemingly lets things wash over them without the ability to do something about it.

Experts have linked this issue to several conditions that affect the way your brain works, including: addictions, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, schizophrenia,...

Reduce the cognitive load anywhere you can.

**Design for cognitive support**:

- simplify navigation with clear menus
- auto save forms, tasks, or projects that are still in progress
- use consistent layouts to reduce cognitive load
- music enhances the motivation in ADHD brains by improving the state of flow and even helping with emotional regulation, it can also help to reduce the feeling of overwhelm.

**Minimise overstimulation**:
By creating calmer, safer interfaces, designers can help prevent sensory overload that triggers a functional freeze state.
Provide a safe space, where the system is the one needing to work more efficient, not the user.

- avoid autoplay videos and unexpected animations
- offer user control over sensory elements like sound and motion
- reduce the sense of urgency
- avoid popup alerts
- look into calm technology again

# Dyslexic

**Context**:
Worldwide, around 10% of people have dyslexia, a neurological disability that impairs a person's ability to read and write. There is evidence that the typographic presentation of the written document has a significant effect on a text's accessibility for people with dyslexia. One of the most significant factors that effects readability of the text is a typeface and/or its variations.

According to Marta Korendo, diagnostic and therapeutic practice can easily reveal evidence of impaired visual perception, usually consisting in:

- confounding similar letters
- skipping lines of text while reading
- ignoring the left side of the space
- changing the order of characters in texts while reading
- skipping diacritics
- problems with reading short words
- difficulty in finding words and passages in a text that has been read

'Scholar within' states that when reading aloud, the average reader can read 183 words per minute.

## Saccades in eye-tracking

In eye-tracking studies conducted by Maria Pia Bucci et Al, saccades and fixations were recorded during the process of reading and word search in a text. The study involved three children:

- an 11-year-old with dyslexia
- a 9-year-old without dyslexia
- an 11-year-old without dyslexia

The study found that the **dyslexic child had more fixations and regressions**. The eye movements of the 9-yo were less accurate than those of the non-dyslexic 11-yo but were nevertheless much more precise than the eye movements of the 11-yo with dyslexia.

A dyslexic person who has difficulty understanding the meaning of a written text must return to earlier passages more frequently, which creates the impression of irregular saccadic movements.

## Visual stress

Between 10% and even 60% of dyslexic people are affected by a wide range of visual stress symptoms. Evenly printed lines of text cause discomfort and inability to concentrate. The visual perception of text becomes distorted: words become fuzzy or blurred, some letters become erased, letters and words overlap, creating a halo effect, letters bend, creating the effect of a waving line of printed text, some letters and words move closer whereas other move away from one another, creating vertical corridors, letters rise and fall, creating a wave effect, the text forms a three-dimensional convergent perspective, or blurred text begins to spin around a central point with a correct focus.

## Assistive technology

**Assistive technology tools** can help a dyslexic person navigate the web.
They consist of:

- screenreaders
- text presentation controls
- reading focus tools
- speech recognition software
- writing assistance software
- text to speech readers

# Dyslexia font

> Common typefaces that are friendly for dyslexics and selected font types designed specifically for people with dyslexia.

Over the last decade, at least seven different typefaces were specifically designed for people with dyslexia.

- Lexia Readable
- Sylexiad
- Gill Dyslexic and Dyslexie
- Read Regular
- OpenDyslexic
- Polish Doferm

Among them, **Dyslexie** and **OpenDyslexie** have gained the greatest popularity.

## Dyslexie

In Dyslexie:

- letters are strongly thickened at the bottom
- they support imagination by 'adding weight' to the characters in order to prevent them from reversing, rotating or 'flying away'
- the axis in certain letters is more inclined, which brings them closer to handwritten characters and, thus easier to distinguish
- the openings in letters are suitably wide, which is intended to improve their readability
- similar-looking letters were designed different heights to maximise their distinctiveness
- unsymmetrical arcs were introduced to augment the difference between 'twin characters'
- the upper and lower extensions of letters were significantly increased in comparison with standard typefaces to enhance their shapes and to increase the distinctiveness of individual characters
- the greater-than-standard x-height also improves the distinctiveness of characters without upper and lower extensions
- in order to improve the readability of entire sentences and components of complex utterances, capital letters as well as punctuation marks dividing and ending the sentence were enlarged and thickened
- letter spacing and word spacing was enlarged in comparison to standard typefaces in order to prevent adjacent letters and words from merging.
