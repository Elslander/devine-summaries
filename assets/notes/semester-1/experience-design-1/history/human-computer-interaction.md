# Human Computer Interaction

Human-computer interaction (HCI) is a multidisciplinary field of study focusing on the **design of computer technology** and, in particular, the **interaction** between humans (the users) and computers.

While initially concerned with computers, HCI has since expanded to cover almost all forms of information technology design.

## The internet of things

**Checklist**:

- Everyday objects
- Connected to a network
- Can measure and exchange data
- Which can enable an action to take place

## A little bit of history

### Nikola Tesla

> **Nikola Tesla**<br />
> When wireless is perfectly applied the whole world will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and thythmic whole...and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present relephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket.

### Jay B Nash

> **Jay B Nash**<br />
> The machine frees (...) Within our grasp is the leisure of the greek citizen, made possible by our mechanical slaves, which far outnumber his twelve to fifteen per free man...<br />
> We are becoming spectators to our own lives.

- Accelerometers
  - Airbags,...
- Acoustic sensors
  - Hearind aids, earthquakes,...
- Resonators
  - MRI,...
- Gyroscopes
  - Rotation speed in airplace navigation systems,...
- ...

  - first smart object
- For inventory and measured coolness

### World Wide Web (1989)

- Tim Berners-Lee
- Made the first web browser in 1990
- URL: Uniform Resource Locators

### Mark Weiser

> **Mark Weiser**<br />
> The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.

- Father of ubiquitous computing
- Chief scientist at Xerox PARC

> **Mark Weiser**<br />
> Now we are in the personal computing era, person and machine staring uneasily at each other across the desktop. Next comes ubiquitous computing, or the age of calm tehcnology, when technology recedes into the background of our lives.

> **Mark Weiser**<br />
> Ubiquitous computing is roughly the opposite of virtual reality. Where virtual reality puts people inside a computer-generated world, ubiquitous computing forces the computer to live out here in the world with people.

### Bluetooth (1994)

- Ericsson
- Originally invented for wireless headsets
- Named after Blatand the Viking from the story "**The Long Ships**" of Frans G Brengtsson. He united all the free Vikings in Denmark under his command and were under his command (communication).
