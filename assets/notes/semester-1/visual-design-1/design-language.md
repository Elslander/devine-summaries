### Plagiarism & copyright

#### AI

- AI generated imagery are not created by your creation process. So not your visual language. You can not use them in your design.
- AI generated imagery are only allowed if communicated so.

#### Allustration

- Do not copy = **plagiarism**: Illustrations are of your own hand.
- Show your trials & progression.
- Don't let AI design your work.
- Do not copy existing artwork.
- Not sure? Go on consult and ask.
- Redrawing is also plagiarism.
- Tutorials are great learning tools but can not be claimed as your own design.

#### Free imagery (or paying)

- **Free** vectors / packs / kits / images /... (or paid) are not your own design.
- Adjustments and complications of existing drawings are not your own design.

#### Copyright in Devine

- A photo can be a starting point of your own illustration.
- Leave no doubt about who created the work.
- Submit your design process, make screenshots of your design process.
- Leave all steps in your illustration file = uncorrected files.
- Do not flatten your layers in PSD, keep your source images in a separate folder.

#### Photos
- Do not copy = **plagiarism**: Using a styled photo is using the work of a photographer = not ok.
- Even if youn change the colour.
- Important: set your own mood for the graphic design, develop your own personal visual language.
- Setting your own graphic style by making your own compilation of photo's / collage is ok. Work with photos that do not yet have a graphic style.
