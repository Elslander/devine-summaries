# Framing your research questions

## Put it in a Problem / Research question

1. Issue tree
2. Ishikawa diagram
3. Framing research question

### Issue tree

**Goal**: define a research question. It's one maine question with several sub questions.

### Ishikawa Diagram (fish-diagram)

Ishikawa diagram offers a simple framework for finding root causes of problems:

1. Define the problem
2. Identify contributing factors or categories
3. Find possible root causes related to each factor

### Framing research question

Tips on formulating a research question:

1. Start with the problems (or insights) you've uncovered.
2. Avoid suggesting a solution in your HMW question.
3. Keep your HMWs broad.
4. Focus your HMWs on the desired outcome.
5. Phase your HMWs questions posively.

**No _yes-_ or _no-questions_, and no _why_ questions**.

## Get to know your topic

### (Early) Secondary Research

It all starts with _reading_ about your _topic_, _similar cases_ and all _relevant information_ that has to do with your case.

**Why so early?**

- Cost-effective and _Time-efficient_.
- It will form the basis for the _primary research_.
- _Assumptions_: helps you select or deselect your assumptions.
  - for now the relevance is more superficial;
  - later on in the research project you need your secondary research to validate certain assumptions.

**Be critical of the quality of your sources!**

### Competitor analysis

- Is more the _surrounding_ of your theme.
- Which competitors have _significant influence_ on your topic and/or client?
- Know their _strengths_, _weaknesses_ and _impact_ on your definition.

**What are the benefits?**

- Learn from the interaction choices of _your competitors' customers_.
- Can help _when you don't have any users_ yet.

**When to make a competitor analysis**:

1. What are the features, functions, flows and feelings from users when they use a competitor's product?
2. Look for the great stuff and the bad stuff.
3. With those insights you can make another superior product and/or experience.

**Questions to get started with**:

- Who is currebtly trying to solve this problem?
- How are they trying to solve the problem?

---

- What is the main differentiator or unique value-add for the product?

---

- Did anyone try to solve it in the past and fail?
- How did they fail?
