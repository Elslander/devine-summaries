# Xerox PARC (Summary)

## Overview

- Founded in **1970** as **Palo Alto Research Center (Xerox PARC)**.
- Built upon ideas from Engelbart and Sutherland to develop the modern **GUI**.
- **Alan Kay's vision**: Focus on the **Dynabook** (portable personal computer) and user-centered design.
- Motto: _"The best way to predict the future is to invent it."_

## Cognitive Psychology & GUI

- Research incorporated **cognitive psychology** to understand learning and interaction.

### Jean Piaget

- Studied **cognitive development** in children:

  - **Sensorimotor (0–2):** Learn through senses/actions.
  - **Preoperational (2–7):** Language & symbolic play emerge.
  - **Concrete operational (7–11):** Logical thinking develops.
  - **Formal operational (12+):** Abstract/deductive reasoning.

- Alan Kay argued GUIs should mix **symbols, images, and actions** (inspired by how people think/learn).

### Jerome Bruner

- **Learning stages:**
  1. **Enactive:** Learning by doing (e.g., using a mouse).
  2. **Iconic:** Learning through images (icons/windows).
  3. **Symbolic:** Learning through symbols (programming/language).

## Key Innovations

### Alto (1973)

- First PC with a **practical GUI**.
- Introduced **icons**, **WYSIWYG** editors, and networking via **Ethernet**.
- Popular programs: Bravo (font editor), SuperPaint.
- Featured early **multiplayer gaming** (Maze War) via **ARPANET**.

### Xerox Star (1982)

- Showcased **WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer)** model.
- Used familiar metaphors (e.g., file cabinets as icons).
- Adopted **mouse as standard** input device.

## Apple & the Macintosh

- **Steve Jobs visited Xerox PARC**, adopting many ideas.
- **Apple Lisa** (1983): First Apple GUI computer; overpriced and failed.
- **Macintosh (1984):**
  - Affordable GUI computer for the masses.
  - Launched with the iconic **"1984" Super Bowl ad**.
  - Cemented Apple’s vision and popularized GUI computing.

## Key Points

- Xerox PARC pioneered the **GUI**, WIMP, and user-focused design.
- Integrated psychology into HCI (learning by doing, visuals + symbols).
- Inspired Apple Macintosh and shaped modern computing interfaces.
