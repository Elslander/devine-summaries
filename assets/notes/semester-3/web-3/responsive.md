### Mobile first

- Almost the HTML structure
- Use `min-width` (or `width >=`) queries
- Progressively enhance your design

### Media query units

**MDN**

"_Use **em** for a11y reasons._"

**Web.dev**

"_You can use any CSS length units in your media queries. If your content is mostly **image-based**, **pixels** might make the most sense. If your content is mostly **text-based**, it probably makes more sense to use a relative unit that's based on text size, like **em** or ch._"

**Josh W Comeau**

"_I recommend using **rem** for media queries. It means that users who crank up their default font sie will see the "mobile" view even on a desktop computer, but this is generally a better user experience than a super-crowded desktop layout with huge text._"
