Typography is a form of expression. Expression in writing.

# Part 1

## What is Typography

Most designers think typography is about fonts.

> **Mark Boulton**
> Typography us more than that, its expressing language through type. Placement, composition, and type choice.

## Type timing

## Legibility & readability

1. **Legibility**:
   How legible are the letters of a font.
   How quickly ad easily do we recognise the characters?
   _> Type designer_
2. **Readability**:
   How pleasant is the text to read? How did the designer use the font?
   _> Graphic designer_

### How do we read a test?

**Fixations** are the points at which our eyes stop moving to process what we have read. **Saccades** are the jumping motions our eyes make between fixations.

> - It does not matter in which order the letters of a word are in as long as the first and last letter are correct.
> - The upper part of letters are easier to recognise. Especially the letter shapes.
> - We tend to skip over filler words.

### Basic tips for legibility

- X-height and counters.
  - Big or small x-height?
- Alignment: left, right or centered?
  - Do not use justify text, it adds a lot of white space in between words, these are called rivers.

### Basic tips for readability

- Size
- Letter-spacing / tracking and kerning:
  - Words in capitals are easier to read when you provide extra spacing/tracking. This is particularly important at small sizes.
  - **Rule of thumb**: Light typefaces need more spacing, bold need less. This rule only applies to a single word or short title.
  - Small font sizes are easier to read when you provide extra spacing.
- Line length: ideal is between 40 and 60 characters.
  - For texts with longer words a longer line length is oké.
- Line height
  - Not the same for every text size.
- Text hierarchy

### A grid as guidance

Grids manage space and information, encouraging consistency and visual hierarchy.

A grid consists of:

- Margins
- Columns
- Gutters

## Type that feels

1. Display fonts
2. Custom lettering
3. Experimental type
4. Type & Time
5. Practice

### Display fonts

**Expressice fonts**:

- boldness
- ornaments
- unique

**They are Ideal for**:

- brand type / logo
- headings
- graphic mood
- eyecatcher / large scale

**Not Ideal for**:

- body copy
- UI

Use it wisely!

### Custom lettering

- Illustration meets type.
- Start from zero.
- unique
- hand drawn / written

### Experimental type

Challenges traditional rules of typography:

- Any discipline
- Any material
- Art & Experiment
- From physical to digital.

### Type & Time

What type is time based:

- research
- redefine
- Cliché design alert

> The eighties, nineties,... are not 'one' graphic design language. Research the sub branches. Avoid clichés.
