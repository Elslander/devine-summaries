**What is typography?**

Most designers think typography is about fonts.

Typography is more than that, its expressing language through type.
Placement, composition and type choice.

## Terminology & Anatomy, History & Classification

**Lowercase / Miniscule**:

- Individual pieces of metal were kept in boxes called cases. The smaller letter were kept in the lower case.

**Uppercase / Majuscule / Capitalis**:

- Individual pieces of metal were kept in boxes called cases. Capital letters were kept in the upper case.
- Long texts in all capitals are harder to read. Sometimes, they're used deliberately -either to discourage careful reading or, as in design class, to emphasize a point.

**Font families**:

- A font family is a group of type styles that share a name, have similar characteristics an vary only in weight, proportion and angle/

**Bold & Faux Bold**:

- Faux bold is a digitally simulated bold effect applied to text in software, often by thickening the stroke of the characters artificially, rather than using a true bold typeface designed by a typographer. You should use the true bold instead of the 'fake' one.

**Univers**:

- Univers is the name of a sans-serif typeface family designed by Adrian Frutiger and released in 1957. Univers was one of the first typeface families to fulfil the idea that a typeface should form a family of consistent, related designs.

**Super font families**:

- Brings several different letter styles into a single family that includes a sans, slab, text and display. Because they share a common skeleton, each of these styles can work alongside one another.

**Uniwidth typefaces**:

> Not the same as monospaced fonts or non-proportional fonts, these are fonts whose letters and characters each occupy the same amount of horizontal space.

- 'Uniwidth' typefaces, sometimes also called 'equal-width', 'dupleced' or 'multiplexed' typefaces.
- They are proportionally-spaced typefaces, where every character occupies the same space (width) across different cuts or weights.
- They come in handy when designing UI-elements.

## White space

**Leading / line height**:

- Leading is the additional white space inserted between lines of type to give a more readable and attractive appearance.

**Letterspacing: tracking / kerning**:

- **Kerning** is the reduction of white space between two characters (inter-character space).
- **Tracking** is the insertion of additional white space (inter-character space) between letters to make them easier to read or improve the appearance.

**Padding & Marin**

**Line length**

## Special characters

**Ligatures**

## Alignment

Kinds of alignment:

- Flush left
- Centered
- Flush right
- Justified

Concequences of alignment:

- Justified text causes rivers to appear in textblocks. (large white spaces)
- Also avoid the following:
  - __Widows__ =  the last line of a paragrapg gets separated.
  - __Orphans__ = the first line of a paragraph get separated.
  - __Runt__ = a single word get pushed to the next line in a paragraph.

## Tips & Tricks

**Objects & Shapes**:

- Text in shape needs space. So, provide enough white space all around.

**Dark background colour**:

- If you are using a dark background for your text, you should give it a bigger leading (line height).

**Vertical text**:

- NEVER use stacked lowercase. Use small caps lowercase instead.
- Vertical baselines:
  - There is no fixed rule determining whether type should run from top to bottom or from bottom to top. It is more common however, especially in the United States, to run text on the spines of books from top to bottom. (You can also run text up and down simultaneously.)

**Script fonts**:

- If you use script fonts make sure to adjust tracking and kerning to make sure the script connects properly.
- Don't use script fonts for body copy. These fonts are difficult to read when used in long texts.

**Stretch**:

- Don't stretch fonts!

**Text hierarchy**:

- Visual guidance is key.
- Text hierarchy follows the gestalt principles.
- When designing type, try to form nuggets. (pieces / groups of information)

## Font pairing

**Resources**:

- Font book is the font management application that comes pre-installed on mac.
- Google Fonts is a free online library of over 1,000 open-source fonts that can be easily integrated into websites and applications.
- Adobe Fonts comes bundled with Adobe Creative Cloud. It includes thousands of fonts that sync directly to your computer.

**Don't use these**:

- Hobo font
- Comic Sans font
- Papyrus
- Chalkboard font & Chalkdust font
- Curlz font

**Tips**:

1. __Limit your fonts__: Get started with no more than 3 different types of fonts. Or choose one typeface with various font styles. (legible, structured, cohesive)
2. __Style according content__: titles, background, navigation, tags, quotes, sublinks, CTA'q, fun facts,...
3. Avoid pairing fonts that are different but too similar in how they look.
