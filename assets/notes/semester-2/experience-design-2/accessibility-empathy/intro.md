Why care?

Hopefully, this isn't a question you're asking - but if it is, just consider the numbers: It's currently estimated that 1 in 5 people has a disability that could affect how they access online content. That's a huge number of people who may be unable to complete everyday online tasks many of us take for granted - like banking, shopping, or applying for a job.

Making the online world accessible benefits individuals, businesses, and entire societies. But how much do you really know about web accessibility? While many of us may be aware that we fall short when addressing accessibility, most don't know the actual impact that it has in real life.

Disability are ==not only those that are permanent==, but can also be temporary or situational (often, it is not even visible).

Through this lab we aim to give you some insight and empathy as a future designer of digital products used by all people.
