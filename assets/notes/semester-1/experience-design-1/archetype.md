### Insights Discovery

Another way to classify personalities using four colours Red, Blue, Green and Yellow- based on Carl Jung's research into archetypes.

The colours give insight into a person's motivations, development areas, strengths, and their preferred communication style.

## How to analyse data and create archetypes

- Look at your users and their data
- Find the patterns
- Group those common traits, behaviours, wants, needs and/or frustrations together
- Until you have 2-5 distinctive groups
- Then name them and present their characteristics
