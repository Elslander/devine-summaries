# Problem Space Definition & Assumptions

## Assumptions

**Assumption matrix**: Document and organise the uncertainties and risks about the users and the product. It forces you to think as **researchers**, instead of puruing a truth you have not investigated yet.

**Tips**:

1. Early and often
2. Risks will never disappear but you can reduce them
3. Don't hold back. "*An unasked question will forever go unanswered*."

## Problem Space Definition

Define your research field.

Goals, questions, touch points that are linked to the briefing, the question, the challenge and certainly with the user group.

**How do you delineate a Problem Space Definition**:

- Frame of reference of your project until the end of the semester - stick to it.
- You start with a *broad* question which you reduce to a *feasible question*.
- *Ask all kind of questions* that more and more narrow down your pain points / challenge to the *core*.
- Side tracks become extra fields of research, they don't belong to your core.
- Be critical!

**Aspects of a problem space definition**: who, what, where, when, why.

### PSD != Scoping Canvas

We use the scoping canvas as a tool to summarise.

In the Discover Phase, your goal is to immerse yourself in the problem completely through research. In this phase, you should seek to understand, even through assumptions, the context of the problem.

Discover is the phase where you will conduct exploratory research into the problem or challenge presented. Anything from a field visit to secondary research can help you explore your problem.

## Scoping canvas

### 1. The problem - Challenge

What is the core challenge? What is the painpoint? What do you want to learn?

After the xploration with the Ishikawa and issue tree you decide on the final challenge. What is the core according to you?

Describe the goal of the project in max. 2 sentences.

Write down why you choose this case.

### 2. Target audience

Who is the main target group involved in your problem / challenge? What groups are there inside your target audience.

And where will you find them?

### 3. Existing facts

Do your secondary research. What assumptions were easily proved or denied with research. What did you learn about the challenge? What key facts can help you move forward?

### 4. Stakeholders

What stakeholders might be affected? For better or worse?

### 5. Assumptions

What is your current hypothesis? What are your current intuitions? What are your assumptions?

What assumptions will be critical for your research and do you need to explore?

### 6. Limits & Obstacles

What is out of the scope?

But do you find interesting?

### 7. Obstacles

What could block your group in moving forward?

Are there existing solutions that do not work?

### 8. Help

Who can help you? Who might have insights in the challenge?

### What should i do with my PSD?

**Important**:

- keep a record of everything
- every thought, opinion, Q&A, possible track that ultimately leads to your core challenge

**Process**:

- give another insight of how it comes together
- document all answers to how and why you have arrived at your scope
- because this is the process to arrive at your PSD

**Creativity**:

- keep track of your process in a creative and orderly way

## Your research question?

**Lets refine**!

- You know more of the context now.
- You should know who you would like to reach.
- Does the original research question fit perfectly? Or do you want to make small adjustments?
- Explain and document why you (don't) want to change to research question.

<!-- ## Project management

**Dr. Meredith Beldin** developed the team role theory based on common behavioral attributes.

The Beldin model divides the roles into:

- action-oriented
- thought-oriented
- people-oriented

### Action-oriented

#### Implementer

Implementers are practical, organised, and methodical. They excel at **turning ideas into action**, planning and executing tasks with **precision and efficiency**. They are **reliable** and disciplined, ensuring that tasks are completed on time and to a high standard.

**Weaknesses**:

- overly rigid or inflexible
- struggle with adapting to alternative methods of working

#### Shaper

Shapers are dynamic, driven, and highly motivated. They excel at **setting ambitious goals**, pushing boundaries, and **driving the team forward**. They have a strong sense of urgency and are skilled at **overcoming obstacles** and challenges to achieve their objectives. They have a strong **focus on results** and are skilled at motivating and challenging others to achieve their potential.

**Weaknesses**:

- can be too confrontational
- struggle with patience and reflection

#### Completer finisher

True to their name, completers finishers are hard working individuals who **notive fine details** and strive for perfection. They are highly **committed** to their work and take pride in **dilivering high-quality results**. They like **maintaining control** over a task and docus on accuracy.

**Weaknesses**:

- due to perfectionism delays can occur
- struggle to delegate

### Thought-oriented

#### Monitor evaluator

This type is a rational thinker and can put their emotions aside for **problem solving**. Monitor evaluators work best when their projects required **advanced knowledge and strategic planning**. They assess ideas to determine if they are valuable and viable. Then take steps to push those ideas forward. Monitor evaluators are **analytical** and objective.

**Weaknesses**:

- can be too pessimistic with a focus on problems
- struggle with improvisation

#### Plant

Plants are imaginative and original. They excel at generating new ideas and **thinking outside of the box**, often identifying novel solutions to complex problems. They are often **intellectually curious** and **enjoy exploring new concepts** and theories, making them a valuable source of inspiration and insight for the team.

**Weaknesses**:

- can feel lonely in the team because of unconventional thinking
- struggle with practical implementation

#### Specialist

Specialists have in-depth knowledge in their field and they like to contribute to one area of expertise. They often work better alone than in a group. They take pride in their ability to contribute specialised knowledge and skills to the team's efforts.

**Weaknesses**: 

- limited in contribution in broader discussion
- struggle with ideas outside of their specialism

### People-oriented

#### Resource investigator

They have a **natural curiosity** that drives them to explore new ideas and opportunities, and they can be highly persuasive in promoting these ideas to the team. Resource investigators are energetic, charismatic, and adaptable. They **enjoy engaging with others**, have a strong external docus, and are skilled at **identifying opportunities** and resources for the team. Their positive attribute makes them a **natural networker** or facilitator of new businesses.

**Weaknesses**:

- overly optimistic with unrealistic expectations
- struggle with finisheing a project

#### Teamworker

Teamworkers **extroverted personalities** help them function well with other and listen to their teammates. These team members can **adapt easily to changes** in their environment and they know how to **create harmony** if conflict arises. They are **good listiners**, and their diplomatic approach helps to create a positive, inclusive team environment.

**Weaknesses**:

- avoid hard decisions
- struggle with assertiveness and accommodate too easily

#### Coordinator

The coordinator is a team member with great communication skills. Coordinators are often in leadership positions because they promote collaboration and moticate the team to accomplish their goals. They are skilled at recognising the strengths and weaknesses of others and delegate accordingly.

**Weaknesses**:

- perceived as overly controlling or manipulative
- struggle with the details fo implementation
