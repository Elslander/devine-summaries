here can your brand make a difference?
### 2 It's not about you
Don't talk the user by addressing yourself, switch your point of perspective.

**Right**: You ...

The audience eats/wears/uses... your product because they identify with it (...or not).
Your target audience creates your story, let them share and source their stories:

- comments, ratings, views,...

Your target audience is the *protagonist* in the story.

1. Archetypes
2. Classic story patterns
## Archetypes
An **Archetype** is a universal pattern of behaviours.

An **archetype in storytelling** is an idea, symbol, pattern, or character-type, in a story. It's any story element that appears again and again in stories from cultures around the world and symbolises something universal in the human experience.

- Carl Gustav Jung
- Analytical psychology.
- 12 main archetypes.

We have one dominant archetype that guides our human behaviour.

## So where will your story on your website start?
Think on the techniques to compile the information you need on the topic.
Can you set up a story with a climax? Or maybe you enter where some action happens?
Do we get a flashback? Or a flash forward at the start?
Does the end look like the beginning of your site?
