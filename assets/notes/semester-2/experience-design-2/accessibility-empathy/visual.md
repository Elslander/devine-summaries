According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), at least 2.2 billion people worldwide have a vision impairment, of which 43 million of them are blind. This is not a small number, and you can be sure that a large percentage of these individuals are internet users, or potential customers, depending on how you look at it.

Vision loss can affect people of all ages; however, most people with vision impairment and blindness are over the age of 50 years. This age group is becoming larger and lager. Designing you digital products with blind and low vision users in mind is therefore not just a moral imperative, but a smart business decision.

# What can you do as a designer?

In the video on the previous page several aids were mentioned for people with low vision or blindness. Some of these fell in the category of assistive technology. Assistive technology has drastically advanced the way disabled and elderly people interact with the world in the last few decades. Helping to encourage independence, improve capabilities and enhance inclusivity. The way we look at assistive technologies over the years has changed, especially with the digitalisation of our current world in recent times. As a designer you should be aware of these technologies and know how you can support this.

One of the most common aids is the screen reader. Let's take a closer look at this.

## Screen readers

Screen readers are a high-tech assistive technology tool, they work by converting digital text into synthesised speech so that website content can be fully understood. A screen reader not only reads the text but also names the components. Software that reads out the screen - it sounds simple but it is not. On screen, text is usually split in multiple columns and interspersed with images, links, forms and possibly moving information.

**Experience the screen reader**:
Blind computer users never work with a mouse and do everything with key combinations. So to perform a correct test, you should not use a mouse in combination with a screen reader. The blind and visually impaired do not see the screen (or part of it). A screen reader does not know what will come next and does not always get information when something changes on the screen. The lack of overview is hard to imagine for a tester who uses a screen reader but can see the screen.

## What do we do to help?

**Descriptive anchors for links and buttons**:
Links and buttons should have descriptive text that conveys their purpose and destination. Instead of using vague text like '_click here_', use specific descriptions like '_read our blog on accessibility tips_'. This helps screen readers provide blind users with context about where the link leads, making navigation clearer and more intuitive.

**Descriptive titles for every page**:
Each page on your website should have a descriptive title that accurately reflects its content. This helps screen readers announce the purpose of each page, aiding users in understanding whereabouts they are on your site and what each page contains. In this way, clear titles enhance navigation for visually impaired users, making for a better browsing experience overall. Structure your HTML in a logical order and use the appropriate semantic tags like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.

**Add image alt text to provide context**:
As previously mentioned, alt text is crucial for providing context to images, and learning to write effective alt text is a craft in its own right. This text should be concise yet descriptive enough to convey the image's purpose or content.
For instance, instead of labelling an image of a library as '_image123.jpg_', suitable alt text should read: _interior view of a modern library with rows of bookshelves_. This provides enough context for the user to build up a mental picture of the image without being overwhelming them with unnecessary details.
(no more than 150 characters)

**Proper use of hierarchical headings**:
Using hierarchical headings (H1, H2, H3, etc.) correctly allows screen readers to interpret the structure of your content accurately. This is akin to providing a roadmap, enabling users to skim through content and jump to sections that interest them. For example, an article might have an H1 for the page title, H2 for main sections and H3 for subsections. Structuring your page in this way prevents subsections from being confused with main sections, or vice versa.

# Colour contrast

Besides optimising your design for screen readers you can adjust your design to be more accessible for vision impaired users.

Not everyone perceives colour in the same way. Colour blindness, low vision, an incorrectly adjusted screen, sun reflection on a smartphone, an outdated screen,... These are just a few examples of things that can change the appearance of your website. This is why it is important not to rely solely on colour to display information.

Picking good contrasting colours is knowing where to find them on the colour wheel. You should pick colours opposite of each other, they have the most contrast. Only be mindful, contrast also means that sometimes small text will start dancing. So find the right tone when combining complementary colours so the contrast is not too high.

The colour wheel below gives you an easy guide to finding high contrast colours. A dark colour from the hues in the lower half set against a light colour from the upper half will provide strong contrast. Avoid relying on the contrast between light colours from the bottom half and dark colours from the top half.

## Tips & Tricks

Here are several tips & tricks to keep in mind for your next UI design:

- If you view a web page in **greyscale**, no information should be lost.
- **Actions** should not be indicated only by colour. Consider, for instance, correcting incorrectly filled form fields, indicating the wrong field in red. Add explanatory text. If you expect input from a visitor, ask for it explicitly. Don't rely on colour alone.
- **Elements** should be clear to every user. Consider, for example, buttons that are visually distinguishable from their background only through colour.
- Add **icons**, **text** or **patterns** to graphs and charts. A graph that relies on colour is not useful for a colour-blind person.
- **Describe** elements on a website with more than colour.
- Do not place **text** over busy images. If necessary, use white text with a black border. Or use semi-transparent backdrops (bud actually both are bad :) ).

# Fonts & Sizes

The visually impaired visitor to a website wants to make the best use of their remaining vision. **A magnification programme** may be a solution. This tool zooms in on the screen image, cause a loss of overview. That problem can be overcome by using a larger monitor.

Imagine you would always have to zoom to see what is on a page. That would be hard.
The WCAG 2.0 recommendation states that the entire website text must be resizable up to 200% without assistive technology and loss of content or functionality. You should also apply this guideline for touch displays and pinch-zooming behaviour. What seems like a small detail has a significant impact on people with visual disabilities. Instead of holding their devices right in front of their noses to see and read the content, they can simply zoom in.
