# 1 Visibility of System Status

Designs should keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate, timely feedback.

**Examples**:

- Interactive mall maps have to show people where they currently are, to help them understand where to go next.
- Multistep processes show users which steps they've completed, they're currently working on, and what comes next.
- Touchscreen UIs need to reassure users that their taps have an effect - often through visual change or haptic feedback.

# 2 Match between systems and the Real World

The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon.

**Examples**:

- When stovetop controls match the layout of heating elements, users can quickly understand which control maps to each heating element.
- If users think about this object as a "car", use that as a label instead.
- A shopping cart icon is easily recognisable because that feature serves the same purpose as its real-life counterpart.

# 3 User Control and Freedom

Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action.

**Examples**:

- Digital spaces need quick "emergency" exits, just like physical spaces do.
- These functions give users freedom because they don't have to worry about their actions - everything is easily reversible.
- Users shouldn't have to commit to a process once it's started - they should be able to easily cancel and abandon.

# 4 Consistency and Standards

Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.

**Examples**:

- Check-in counters are usually located at the front of hotels. This consistency meets customers' expectations.
- Using elements from the same design system across the product lines lowers the learning curve of users.
- A standardised notification design provides a similar but distinguishable look and feel for different app pop-ups.

# 5 Error Prevention

Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place.

**Examples**:

- Guard rails on curvy mountain roads prevent drivers from falling of the cliffs.
- The confirmation page before checking out on airline websites gives users another chance to review the flight details.
- Offer good defaults and set boundaries when people book services by dates. Grey out unavailable options.

# 6 Recognition Rather Than Recall

Minimise the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. Avoid making users remember information.

**Examples**:

- People are more likely to correctly answer the question "Is Lisbon the capital of Portugal?" rather than "What's the capital of Portugal?".
- Comparison tables list key differences so that users don't need to remember them to make comparisons.
- Search queries are presented together with the results are a reference.

# 7 Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

Shortcuts - hidden from novice users - may speed up the interactions for the expert user.

**Examples**:

- Regular routes are listed on maps, but locals with more knowledge of the area can take shortcuts.
- Keyboard shortcuts for complex products can help expert users finish their tasks more efficiently.
- Social apps allow two ways to like posts. Experienced users can tap to like because it speeds up their browsing.

# 8 Aesthetic and Minimal Design

Interfaces should not contain information which is irrelevant. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information.

**Examples**:

- Excessive decorative elements can interfere with usability.
- Over-decoration can cause distraction and make it harder for people to get the core information they need.
- Messy UI increases the interaction cost for users to find their desired content; Organised UI lowers the cost.

# 9 Recognise, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

**Examples**:

- Wrong-way signs on the road remind drivers that they are heading in the wrong direction and ask them to stop.
- Good internet connection error pages show what happened and constructively instruct users on how to fix the problem.
- Provide useful help when people encounter search-result pages returning zero results, such as popular topics.

# 10 Help and Documentation

It's best if the design doesn't need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users complete their tasks.

**Examples**:

- Information kiosks at airports are easily recognisable and solve customers' problems in context and immediately.
- Good frequently-asked-questions pages anticipate and provide the helpful information that users might need.
- Information icons reveal tooltips to explain jargon when users touch or hover over them, which provides contextual help.
