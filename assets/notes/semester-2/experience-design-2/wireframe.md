A Flowchart combined with the content list is a wireframe.

- **Layout**: What content is most important on my page? What place does it get? How much space?
- **Functionality**: How will it work? What are the interactions with the visitor?
- **Navigation**: What is interconnected? A step further than the global navigation.

There are 3 types of wireframes:

1. low fidelity
2. mid fidelity
3. high fidelity

# Low fidelity wireframes

A low fidelity wireframe is a quick and dirty sketch. We do this **on paper**.

Why on paper?

- fast & cheap
- visualise the basic idea
- accessible
- encourage honest input / feedback
- freedom from templates
- start a conversation
- basic navigation sketches

## Annotations

Always add annotations to these sketches. This is done in all 3 types of wireframes.

Always explain why you made a certain choice.
Tips:

- keep it short
- explain what happens
- explain why
- use numbers
- place all your notes _outside_ of the wireframe

## Symbols

## Summary (low-fi)

- on paper
- universal symbols
- grey boxes / lines for text
- titles are real text
- annotate - communicate interactions

# Mid fidelity wireframes

This is when the low fidelity wireframe does digital.

- dummy text becomes lorem ipsum
- varying font size is used to differentiate headlines and body text
- clearer delineated / detailed
- greyscale

It is seen as an in between stage. This means it can still be done on paper.

# High fidelity wireframes

- realistic
- extremely detailed
- fully written content

You need to show the interactions if the design is touch based.

## Summary (hi-fi)

- in greyscale
- universal icons
- fully written content
- partner up and test (often) - make iterations
- annotate - communicate interactions

# Wireframe or design

To transition from a wireframe / prototype to a design, it must be approached creatively.

All content / functionality must be present so that the designer can translate. It's an interpretation of the greyscale model.
Don't just fill in colours.
