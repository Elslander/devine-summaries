# Universal design

## What is universal design?

Universal design is the design of buildings, products or environments to make them accessible to people, **regardless of age, disability or other factors**.

It is creating things that could be **used by the maximum number of people possible**.

## Berkeley California (example)

**1960**
A group of disabled students motivated by the rebellious atmosphere of those times took matters in their own hands and introduced curb cuts on the main roads of the campus.

> Curb cuts also benefit pedestrians if they are using **walker** or **cane** or **wheelchair**, pushing a **stroller**, **buggy** for babies, pushing or pulling **a cart**, or **walking next to a bicycle**; as well as anyone riding a **bicycle**, **roller skates**, or **a skateboard**.

_One design fits all_.

# Inclusive design

## What is inclusive design?

Inclusive Design is a methodology, born out of digital environments, that enables and draws on the full range of human diversity.

Most importantly, this means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives.

## Importance?

One out of five people have a disability that challenges them in daily life.

**Only one out of five have no disability at all**!

## EU accessibility act

The goal of the act is to **harmonise and standardise accessibility rules**, so that products and services use a "**_design for all_**" **approach**. According to the UN Convention of Rights on the Persons of Disabilities, that approach "_means the design of products, environments, programs and services **should be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialised design**._"

## Four principles of accessibility

**Perceivable**:
The content must be available to users via sight, hearing, and/or touch.

**Operable**:
The product must be keyboard-accessible, navigable, and compatible with different input methods.

**Understandable**:
The content must be readable and predictable, with clear labels and instructions.

**Robust**:
The product must work with a variety of assistive technologies, browsers, and devices.

## Assistive Technology (a11y)

1. OS Settings (font size, colour blindness,...)
2. Assistive software (zooming software, screen reader software,...)
3. Hardware (one handed keyboard,..)

## Universal / Accessible / Inclusive

### Difference between accessible and inclusive

- Woman
- People of colour
- People with non-binary identities (LGBTQ+)
- People wo do not speak English natively
- People with restricted mobility
- People with different cognitive abilities.

**Universal design**:
Design that works for everyone, usable by all people to the greatest extent possible.

**Accessibility**:
Ensures that digital products and content can be used by those with special needs.

**Inclusive design**:
A human-centred design process that embraces diversity.

## Inclusive design & Target audience

- Ethnicity
- Age
- Gender
- Sexuality
- Class

## Applied examples

### Gamification

For those who need the external push.
For those who do not feel confident in their skills.

- Set goals
- Celebrate achievements
- Give rewards

### Onboarding

For those with less digital experience or less independence.

- Provide onboarding for the main functionality.
- Provide help in the application.
- Think on error prevention.

### Clean design & relaxation

For those who are easily frustrated.
For those who forget to take care of themselves.

- Choose a clear or soothing colour scheme.
- Think on sound design.
- Add a breathing exercise each day, this is maybe part of a digital well being todo feature?
- Give a small encouragement.

### Repeat feature

For those who like improving themselves.
For those who just easily forget.

- Give the ability to set repeating todo's.
- Small reminders to build a habit.

### Priority

For those who like to be in control, who are meticulous in their work.

- Let users assign priority or do this automatically depending on the deadline.
- Add tags, categories, timers, burn-points,...

### Diversity in expression

For those who want to express themselves.
For those who sometimes feel they do not fit in.

- Provide diverse options when creating avatars.
  Think on those 8 blocks from the previous slide.

### Minimal & Colour

For those who are easily distracted.
For those who easily miss information if there is too much.

- Go for minimal design, put the extra's on the second level. Think on the essential and scratch the rest.

### Visual representation`

For those who find it harder to read.
For those who have a more visual mindset.

- Use icons for easy recognition.
- Use a font that is dyslexia friendly.
- Do not go to small with text, or provide options to adjust.

## Recognise exclusion

### Recognise biases

We may not realise it, but all of us have biases, it is human nature.

They affect:

- memory
- decision making
- behaviour
- judgement

Causes of Cognitive bias:

- Emotions
- Motivation
- Heuristics, or mental shortcuts
- Age
- Limited information-processing capacity
- Social influence

**Examples (exam)**:

- _Bandwagon effect_: The bandwagon effect refers to our habit of adopting certain behaviours or beliefs because many other people do the same.
- _Attentional bias_: The attentional bias describes our tendency to focus on certain elements of our environment while ignoring others.
  We focus on emotional stimuli over neutral stimuli.
- _Confirmation bias_: The confirmation bias describes our underlying tendency to notice, focus on, and give greater credence to evidence that fits with our existing beliefs.

## Recognise exclusion

We may not realise it, but some of us have a lot of privilege.

Becoming aware of this is a good step for more objective user research and prevents exclusion.

# Equitable design

| Equality                                                        | Equity                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Everyone gets the same regardless if it's needed or right for them. | Everyone gets wat they need understanding the barriers, circumstances, and conditions. |

## The difference?

**Universal design**:
Aims to prevent exclusion by making products and spaces usable by everyone.

**Inclusive design**:
Actively includes diverse users beyond the scope of disability.

**Design for equity**:
Addresses the underlying systems that perpetuate disparities and looks at historically underrepresented groups.
