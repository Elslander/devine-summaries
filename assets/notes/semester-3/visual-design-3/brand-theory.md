> Why do i like one brand more than another?

## Branding

Branding is the **process** of designing, planning and communicating the **name** and the **identity**, in order to build or manage the **image**.

## The basis

**Brand strategy**:

Plan that outlines how a brand will be _positioned in the market_ and how it aims to connect with it's target audience.

**Brand vision**:

Long-term goal of the brand, what the brand aims to achieve and the _impact_ it hopes to have on its customers (and the world). The brand vision is future driven.

> Everybody knows **what** they do, some know **how** they do it, but only a few know **why** they do it.

**The Golden Circle**:

- Why = The purpose
- How = The process
- What = The result
