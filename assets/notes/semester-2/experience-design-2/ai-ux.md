## AI as a partner in pitching

...

## AI as a partner in writing

Supports you during the writing process.

Use it to check your text for:

- spelling and grammar;
- APA reference check in correct application.

It helps you communicate your thoughts more clearly.
Write a draft and ask for help, ask what it changes so that you stay in control.

**A good prompt** (set a...):

- role
- goal
- context
- action

Avoid bombastic and repetitive sentences.

## AI as a partner in idea generation

Supports you in checking off ideas and gaining new perspectives.

Use it to:

- check off thoughts and start your brainstorming process;
- gather constructive feedback;
- get different feedback;
- get different perspectives;
- know the stakeholder.

Consider these as a possible source of inspiration for when you are stuck or want to explore a topic more deeply.

**Concrete** (example):

- Say: "You are the target audience, what are you frustrations with the topic?"
- Use the _reverse brainstorm technique_ to generate the worst case ideas. (Although this is so much fun to do yourself?)
- As an _addition to your insights_. (Is there something you did not think of?)
- For copywriting content fitting the concept.

## AI as a partner in research

Supports you in making sense of difficult concepts and theories.

Use it to:

- Receive clarifying examples.
- To learn more about a problem. Get a quick overview of the complexity: e.g. who are the stakeholders, what are the assumptions?
- Summarise texts for better understanding.
- See connections between different concepts.

This partner can serve as a guide in deeper understanding and questioning of the subject matter.

It is not the best partner in research because there is no fact-checker. AI is never a source.

Be careful with sensitive information and privacy.
Always check with the description in the course material. Or work with NotebookLM where you are in control of the source.
